# CSS Update App

When you first load the app, this is what you will see:
![Landing page](https://github.com/taylornoj/cssUpdateApp/blob/master/docs/default-page.jpg?raw=true)

You are able to change the spacing around the image, the blur and base colour. The base colour also changes the 'JS' in the heading:
![Edited work on app]()

This project was built with starter code from the [JavaScript 30 challenge]().
