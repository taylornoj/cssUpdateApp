# CSS Update App
![](cssapp.mov)

When you first load the app, this is what you will see:

You are able to change the spacing around the image, the blur, border radius and base colour. The base colour also changes the 'JS' in the heading:

This project was built with starter code from the [JavaScript 30 challenge](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30).
Beyond the starter code, I modified the image, background color, text size and added a border-radius feature.

# What I learned:
- css variables and accessing them in JavaScript
- calling .querySelectorAll() returns a NodeList with a few methods listed inside (including the forEach method which we will use to loop over our inputs)
